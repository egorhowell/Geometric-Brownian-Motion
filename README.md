# Geometric-Brownian-Motion
This is the code for my second year project where I simulated the stock market using geometric brownian motion. 

- Stochastic motion of the stock price
- Implementing Kelly's Criterion
- Comparing the model with the share price movement of Tesla, Apple and Microsoft
- Calculating which invesmnet strategy is best
