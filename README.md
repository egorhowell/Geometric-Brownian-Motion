# Geometric-Brownian-Motion
This is the code for my second year project where I simulated the stock market using geometric brownian motiom which a subset of the Black Scholes Model.

This project included modelling:

- Stochastic motion of the stock price and initial capital
- Simulating the effects of different volatility and drift values
- Implementing Kelly's Criterion to maxmise captial gains
- Comparing the model with the share price movement of Tesla, Apple and Microsoft
- Calculating the optimal investment strategy
